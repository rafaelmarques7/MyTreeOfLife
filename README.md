## Description

- `Neo4j` for graph database
- `React` with `ChakraUI`
- `TypeScript`
- `react-graph-vis` for graph visualization

##Â Connection to neo4j

- Connection to Neo4j requires the `.env` variables to be set (see [env.ts](./src/env.ts) file)
- This app can run without a connection to Neo4j. In this case, it uses some dummy data.
